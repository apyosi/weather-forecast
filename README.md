# Weather Forecast Dashboard

## Overview
Use the 5 Day Weather Forecast to retrieve weather data for cities. The base URL for the API calls should look like the following: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}.

    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
* When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
* When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
